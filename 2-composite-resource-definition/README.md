# Composite Resource Definitions (XRD) and Compositions

This folder has a definition and composition YAML file. The definition will be the new API created in Kubernetes
and the composition is will build the following resources with the new API.

* One S3 bucket
* Ownership preferences on the S3 bucket
* A new role, policy and role policy attachment

This approach shows how the power of Crossplane XRDs combined with compositions will enable building a group of resources
with a single API call.

## Steps
1. Follow [setup](../README.md)
2. Create the definition and composition on you cluster. 
   * `kubectl apply -f defintion.yaml`
   * `kubectl apply -f composition.yaml`
3. Modify the claim (examples/s3bucket.yaml) and modify changme to something else.
4. Apply the claim
   * `kubectl apply -f examples/s3bucket.yaml)`
5. Verify managed resources. 
   * `kubectl get managed`
