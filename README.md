# Crossplane Demo

There are three demos in this repo to show different ways to use Crossplane to build a S3 bucket in AWS.

* Managed Resources - Build each resource on its own 
* Composite Resource Definition - Create a XRD and Composition to build everything with one API call
* IAM Builder - Same as #2, however this uses Upbound's IAM Builder functionality to automatically build the IAM and reduce configuration burden by 45%.
